                <div id="mainSectionMenu">
                    <h2>Main Section and Main Menu</h2>
                    <p>The main section of the PageIntel extension provides a convenient way for you to interact with

                        workflow and make it easy for you to execute tasks and get answers to your queries.</p>

                    <h3>Running Predefined Tasks</h3>
                    <p>PageIntel comes with a set of predefined tasks that you can execute with just a click. These
                        tasks are displayed in the main section as a list of task items. To run a task, simply locate
                        the desired task in the list and click on the "play" icon (▶) associated with it. PageIntel will

                        based on its AI capabilities.</p>

                    <h3>Saving Impromptu Questions as Tasks</h3>
                    <p>If you find yourself frequently asking similar questions or if you want to save an impromptu
                        question for future use, PageIntel provides the ability for you to save these questions as
                        predefined tasks. After entering a question and receiving a satisfactory response, click on the
                        "save" icon (💾) next to the question input field. You will be prompted to enter a name for the
                        task. Once saved, the question will appear in the task list as a new predefined task.</p>
                    <p>To further refine the saved task, you can go to the settings panel by clicking on the gear icon
                        (⚙) in the main menu. In the settings panel, locate the newly saved task and click on it to
                        expand its details. Here, you can add a description for the task, specifying its purpose or any
                        additional information. Additionally, you can define the applicable URLs where the task should
                        be available. This allows you to limit the task's visibility to specific web pages or domains.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Task Filtering</h3>
                    <p>As you accumulate more predefined tasks, the task list in the main section can become lengthy. To
                        help you quickly find the desired task, PageIntel provides a task filtering feature. In the main
                        menu, located at the top of the main section, you will find a search icon (🔍). Clicking on this
                        icon will reveal an input field where you can enter keywords or phrases to filter the task list.
                        As you type, the task list will dynamically update to show only the tasks that match your search
                        query. To clear the filter and display all tasks again, click on the clear icon (❌) next to the
                        filter input field.</p>
                    <p>The main section and main menu of PageIntel provide a user-friendly interface for you to execute
                        predefined tasks, ask impromptu questions, and manage your saved tasks. With the ability to save
                        questions as tasks, refine them in the settings panel, and filter the task list, PageIntel
                        empowers you to streamline your workflow and quickly access the information you need.</p>

                    <p>AI Tasks are the foundational element of PageIntel, centralizing the extension's capabilities to
                        automate and enhance user interactions with web content using artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>AI Tasks are the foundational element of PageIntel, centralizing the extension's capabilities to
                        automate and enhance user interactions with web content using artificial intelligence. These
                        tasks are designed to simplify complex processes, from data extraction to content analysis, by
                        intelligently processing web page data.</p>

                    <h3>How AI Tasks Work</h3>
                    <p>The workflow of AI Tasks in PageIntel is a systematic process that integrates data extraction
                        with AI processing:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Task Definition</strong>: Users define AI Tasks using a specific prompt structure
                            that may include placeholders for data tags.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Tag Execution</strong>: When an AI Task is triggered, PageIntel first
                            identifies the data tags embedded within the task prompt. These tags are used to extract
                            specific data elements from the current web page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Replacement</strong>: Extracted data replaces the corresponding data tags in
                            the AI Task prompt, transforming it into a complete query ready for processing.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI Processing</strong>: The fully formed query is sent to an AI model, which
                            processes the information and generates a response based on the input.</li>
                        <li><strong>Response Display</strong>: The AI's response is then displayed back to the user,
                            providing insights, summaries, or any other requested analysis.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Writing Effective AI Task Prompts</h3>
                    <p>Writing effective prompts for AI Tasks is crucial for achieving accurate and relevant AI
                        responses. The prompts should be clear and direct, with properly placed data tags to ensure
                        precise data extraction. Here are some tips and examples for prompt writing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Be Specific</strong>: Clearly state what the AI needs to do with the data once
                            extracted. The more specific the prompt, the more accurate the AI's response.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Data Tags Wisely</strong>: Place data tags where the extracted data will be most
                            meaningful for the AI's processing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Context Matters</strong>: Provide enough context in the prompt to guide the AI's
                            response in the right direction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example prompts include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Price Comparison Task</strong>: "Compare the current price of {product-name} at
                            {product-price} with historical prices and advise if it's a good time to buy."</li>
                        <li><strong>Content Summary Task</strong>: "Summarize the key points from the following article:
                            {page-full-content}."</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>URL Filters and Wildcards in AI Tasks</h3>
                    <p>URL filters in PageIntel define the scope of web pages where AI Tasks will be activated, allowing
                        for targeted application of tasks to relevant content. The flexibility of URL filters is crucial
                        for ensuring that tasks operate efficiently and only when necessary.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Blank Filters</strong>: If no URL filter is specified, the AI Task will be
                            considered applicable to all pages. It is important that such a task is general enough to be
                            relevant across different webpages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Single and Multiple Filters</strong>: Users can specify single or multiple URL
                            filters to narrow down the task's applicability. For example, a price monitoring AI Task
                            might be set to trigger on URLs like <code>*amazon.com/products*</code>,
                            <code>*ebay.com/offers*</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Use of Wildcards</strong>: Wildcards (<code>*</code>) allow flexibility in matching
                            URL patterns, enabling the task to be triggered on broader URL patterns such as
                            <code>*.newswebsite.com/*</code> which would cover all subdomains of
                            <code>newswebsite.com</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Domain Filters</strong>: For tasks that require data from multiple sources,
                            URL filters can span different domains, such as <code>*cnn.com/news*</code>,
                            <code>*bbc.com/news*</code> to compare news coverage on similar topics across different news
                            websites.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>By using URL filters effectively, users can ensure that AI Tasks are triggered only under
                        appropriate conditions, maximizing the extension's utility and performance across varied web
                        environments. This selective activation helps conserve resources and ensures that the output
                        from AI Tasks is as relevant and useful as possible.</p>

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Automated Scraping</strong>: Automatically extract and save the data specified by
                            the tag when visiting a web page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Use the tag to gather specific types of data for analysis,
                            such as extracting all product prices from an e-commerce site.</li>

                            expected.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Advanced Data Tagging: CSS Selectors and JSON Paths</h3>

                    <h4>CSS Selectors</h4>
                    <p>CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style in a webpage. In
                        PageIntel, you use CSS selectors to define which elements to extract data from. Examples include
                        simple selectors like <code>div</code>, <code>#header</code>, or <code>.price</code>, and
                        combinator selectors like <code>div > p</code> which selects all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements
                        that are direct children of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>

                    <h4>JSON Paths for Advanced Tagging</h4>
                    <p>For more complex structures such as iframes or shadow DOMs, JSON paths are used. These provide a
                        structured way to navigate through nested elements or across different document contexts like
                        iframes or shadow DOMs.</p>
                    <pre><code>{
                    "selectors": [
                        {
                            "iframe_path": ["iframe#main", "iframe#content"],
                            "shadow_dom_path": ["div#shadowHost", "shadowRoot"],
                            "element_selector": "p.price"
                        }
                    ]
                }</code></pre>
                    <p>This JSON path configuration allows navigation into nested iframes, through shadow DOMs, and
                        directly to the elements of interest, such as <code>p.price</code>.</p>

                    <h4>Use Cases for JSON Paths</h4>
                    <p>Example use case includes extracting product prices from an e-commerce platform where product
                        details are loaded within an iframe and prices are displayed within shadow DOMs:</p>
                    <pre><code>{
                    "selectors": [
                        {
                            "iframe_path": ["iframe#productFrame"],
                            "shadow_dom_path": ["div#productDetails", "shadowRoot"],
                            "element_selector": "span.price"
                        }
                    ]
                }</code></pre>

                    <h4>Testing and Validation</h4>
                    <p>Set up the tag with the appropriate JSON path or CSS selector, test it on a relevant page, and
                        check the results to ensure accurate data extraction.</p>

                    <p>By effectively using data tags, PageIntel users can tailor the extension to meet their precise
                        data collection and monitoring requirements, making web interactions more efficient and
                        productive.</p>

                        in PageIntel.</p>
                    <p>The configuration of the AI Key and AI URL in PageIntel is a crucial aspect that enhances the
                        flexibility and security of how AI tasks are handled within the extension. This setup not only
                        allows for seamless integration with enterprise systems but also supports advanced
                        customizations and secure data handling.</p>

                    <h3>AI Key Configuration</h3>
                    <p>The AI Key is a critical component in PageIntel, enabling the extension to authenticate and
                        interact with AI services. This key is typically used to authorize API calls made to AI services
                        like OpenAI or any other large language models (LLMs) that the extension might communicate with.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Security</strong>: The AI Key is securely stored and managed within the user's
                            PageIntel setup, ensuring that sensitive credentials are kept safe from unauthorized access.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Users can easily enter and update their AI Key through the
                            PageIntel settings panel, allowing for straightforward configuration and maintenance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>AI URL Configuration</h3>
                    <p>The AI URL configuration plays a vital role in how PageIntel interacts with different AI
                        services. By allowing the AI URL to be configurable, PageIntel can support advanced setups, such
                        as routing API calls through an API gateway.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Enterprise Integration</strong>: In an enterprise setup, the API call can be made to
                            an API gateway instead of directly to an AI service. This gateway can reformat the API
                            calls, potentially routing them to different AI services based on the needs and policies of
                            the enterprise.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: The API gateway can handle user authentication via
                            Single Sign-On (SSO) or other authentication methods. This ensures that AI interactions
                            comply with the enterprise's security standards and that user credentials are managed
                            securely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Key Management</strong>: The API gateway can manage the AI Key, meaning that the
                            actual AI service key does not need to be stored within the user's PageIntel setup. This
                            adds an extra layer of security, as the sensitive AI Key is managed and protected by the
                            gateway, reducing the risk of exposure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility and Customization</strong>: Organizations can customize the AI URL to
                            point to different endpoints depending on specific requirements, such as load balancing,
                            failover strategies, or specific data handling rules that comply with local regulations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The default entry for the AI URL is the OpenAI API URL, as this is likely the most common use
                        case. The API call is made in the format required by OpenAI. If the target LLM uses a different
                        format, the message can be translated to their format by the API gateway.</p>

                    <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
                    <p>When configuring the AI URL and AI Key in PageIntel, consider the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compliance and Security</strong>: Ensure that the configuration adheres to your
                            organization's IT security policies and compliance requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Testing and Validation</strong>: Before fully implementing these settings in a
                            production environment, conduct thorough testing to verify that the AI tasks perform as
                            expected and that all security measures are robust.</li>
